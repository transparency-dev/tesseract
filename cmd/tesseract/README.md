# TesseraCT binaries

This directory contains TesseraCT binaries for [AWS or Vanilla S3+MySQL](./aws/),
[GCP](./gcp/), and [POSIX](./posix/).

It also contains Dockerfiles to build these binaries, and to
bundle them with the CA roots they accept.

## TesseraCT configuration

This file explains how to configure TesseraCT binaries.

It contains two main parts:

 1. [Chain lifecyle](#life-of-a-chain): with settings impacting how submission
 are processed
 2. [Setup](#setup): with instructions on how to setup TesseraCT resources

You can find information about implementation-specific settings in each
corresponding subdirectory.

### Life of a chain

When TesseraCT receives a new chain submssion, it is first
[filtered](#chain-filtering), and is then sent to the Tessera library where it goes
through the [process of being added to the log](#adding-to-the-log).
The chain may be [deduplicated using TesseraCT's and Tessera's antispam features](#antispam).

#### Chain filtering

Which chains will be accepted by TesseraCT can be controlled by setting the
following flags to filter submissions:

- `root_pem_file`: Path to a file containing root certificates that are
acceptable to the log. Chains not originating from one of the roots included in
this file will be rejected.
- `reject_expired`: If true, TesseraCT rejects expired certificates.
- `reject_unexpired`: If true, TesseraCT rejects certificates that are either
currently valid or not yet valid.
- `ext_key_usage`: A list of comma separated [Extended Key Usages (EKU) from x509](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509#ExtKeyUsage).
Certificates which DO NOT include one or more of these EKUs to be accepted. If
empty, no filtering is applied.
- `reject_extension`: A comma separated list of X.509 extension OIDs, in dotted
string form (e.g. `2.3.4.5`). Certificates that include one or more of these extensions
will be rejected.
- `not_after_start`: Start of the range of acceptable NotAfter values,
inclusive. Leaving this unset or empty implies no lower bound to the range.
RFC3339 UTC format, e.g: `2024-01-02T15:04:05Z`.
- `not_after_limit`: Cut off point of NotAfter dates - only notAfter dates
strictly _before_ `not_after_limit` will be accepted. Leaving this unset or empty
means no upper bound on the accepted range. RFC3339 UTC format, e.g:
`2024-01-02T15:04:05Z`.
- `accept_sha1_signing_algorithms`: If true, allow chains that use SHA-1 based
signing algorithms. This flag is a temporary solution to allow chains submitted
by Chrome's Merge Delay Monitor Root. It will eventually be removed and chains
using such algorithms will be rejected.
- `limit_old_submissions`: This optional flag can be set define a limit on how
many "old" certificates and precertificates will be accepted per second.
The flag value should be of the form `<age>:<limit>`, where `<limit>` is a
per-second rate limit, and `<age>` defines how old a given submission's
`notBefore` date must be for that submission to be subject to the rate limit.
`<age>` must be formatted per Go's [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration),
and `<limit>` is a positive real number.
E.g. `28h=500` means that a rate-limit of 500 submissions/s will be applied to any
certificate, or precertificate, whose `notBefore` date is at least 28 hours old
at the time of submission.

#### Adding to the log

Tessera stages entries submitted via `Add`, then [sequences them in a batch](#sequencing-and-batching),
assigning them with a durable sequence number. Asynchronously from this, entries
are integrated into the log (i.e durably written into the log together with
hashes commiting to them), and then [published every checkpoint interval](#checkpoint-publication)
(i.e a checkpoint which commits to these new entries is published). TesseraCT
can optionally [wait for the full process to be done](#publication-awaiter)
before sending responses to clients.

##### Sequencing and Batching

The `batch_max_age` and `batch_max_size` flags control the maximum age and number
of entries in a single [sequencing batch](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#sequencing).
These flags affect the overall performance of TesseraCT. The correct values for
these flags depend on multiple factors, such as the driver used, the number
of TesseraCT servers or their steady QPS rate. Defaults values have been chosen sensibly
and should be fine to get started with, but we invite you to experiment with values
tailored to your setup.

##### Checkpoint publication

The `checkpoint_interval` flag controls the duration between two subsequent
checkpoint publications. Due to constraints imposed by underlying storage
systems, this interval has a lower limit. Tessera ensures that the configured
interval is larger than any such lower limit during the initialization process.

| Backend | Minimum Permitted Checkpoint Interval (ms) |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| AWS     | 1000                                       |
| GCP     | 1200                                       |

Note that when used in conjunction with `enable_publication_awaiter`, `checkpoint_interval`
directly impacts `add-*` request response time.

##### Publication awaiter

The `enable_publication_awaiter` flag enables [Tessera's publication awaiter](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#synchronous-publication):
when this flag is on, TesseraCT responds to `add-*` requests only after a
`checkpoint` committing to that entry has been published. When this flag is off,
TesseraCT sends responses to `add-*` requests as soon as Tessera has durably
assigned a sequence number to the corresponding entry. Such entries entries will
then get integrated and published asynchronously, which may or may not happen
before TesseraCT responds to the `add-*` request are sent, or after.

While this flag provides stronger guarantees to clients, it will likely lead to a
lower a log throughput, an increased number of open sockets open, and RAM usage.
Make sure that the `http_deadline` flag leaves enough time for requests
to be fully processed.

This flag is on by default.

#### Antispam

The `pushback_max_antispam_lag`, `pushback_max_dedup_in_flight` and
`inmemory_antispam_cache_size` flags control how [TesseraCT's Antispam feature](/docs/architecture.md#antispam)
works, which itself is built on top of [Tessera's Antispam](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#antispam)
capabilities. It is composed of three main steps:

1. A process **asynchronous** with `add-*`, populates the antispam database
with entry indices as the log grows. This is handled by Tessera.
2. A call **synchronous** with **all** `add-*` to the antispam database to
identifies whether the submission is a duplicate of a previously accepted entry.
This is handled by Tessera.
3. If this entry is a duplicate, a last call **synchronous** with this duplicate
`add-*` call fetches the previous entry from the log to extract the information required
to recreate the previously issued SCT. This is handled by TesseraCT.

The `pushback_max_antispam_lag` flag controls the limit of how far behind the
current size of the tree the asynchronous process in `(1)` can fall.
When this value is exceeded, TesseraCT returns `429 - Too Many Requests` to
**all** `add-*` requests. This protects TesseraCT from accepting new entries
without being able to tell whether they are duplicates of recently integrated
entries.

The `inmemory_antispam_cache_size` flag controls the number of recently-added
entries which indexes are kept in memory.  This both makes subsequent some `(2)`
calls faster, and provides optimistic coverage for entries submitted _very_
recently and which have not yet been processed by the asynchronous process in
`(1)`.

The `pushback_max_dedup_in_flight` flag rate limits how many concurrent `add-*`
requests identified as duplicates will be processed by the
**synchronous** process in `(3)` wich fetches entries and extracts information
required to build SCTs. When this value is exceeded, TesseraCT returns
`429 -Too Many Requests` to subsequent **duplicate** `add-*` requests only.
Non-duplicate `add-*` requests are not impacted, and can still be processed.
This limits the amount of resources TesseraCT spends on servicing duplicate
requests.

### Setup

#### Origin and submission prefix

The origin used in Checkpoints is specified with the `origin` flag, and should
be derived from the submission prefix for the log as explained below.

The submission prefix of a log has two parts, the host and the serving path:
`https://$HOST/$PATH_PREFIX/ct/v1/...`.

As per [static-ct-api specs](https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api):
> the origin line
MUST be the submission prefix of the log as a schema-less URL with no trailing
slashes.

Use your upstream serving infrastructure to make sure that requests to these
URLs are correctly routed to a TesseraCT server. TesseraCT will serve the
requests it receives regardless of their `$HOST`. However, it will expect
requests to be received on `$PATH_PREFIX`, as specifid by the `path_prefix` flag.

#### Memory considerations

TesseraCT's memory footprint is directly impacted by:

- `inmemory_antispam_cache_size`: the number of recently-added entries which indexes
are kept in memory
- `batch_max_size`: the number of entries that are kept in memory before
sequenced in a batch
- [The number of cached issuers keys](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tesseract/blob/main/storage/storage.go)
- `enable_publication_awaiter` and `http_deadline`: they impact the number of
concurent requests, hence the amount of RAM being used

#### Frontend redundancy

For added availability multiple TesseraCT instances can run concurently with the
same Tessera resources. Adding more instances will not necessarily increase
performance, the primary goal of concurrency is to allow for better
availability.

Multiple TesseraCT server can run concurently on AWS or GCP. It is also
possible to run concurent servers with the POSIX and Vanilla S3 + MySQL
implementations, **but** this will depend on the underlying storage systems
being used.

#### Running multiple logs

To run multiple logs, run multiple TesseraCT instances configured with different
Tessera resources. For simplicity, it is not possible to serve multiple logs
from a single TesseraCT instance.
